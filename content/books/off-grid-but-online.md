## What's Inside

You don't have to choose between modern comfort and self-sufficiency. This book shows you how to build a home that generates its own power, catches its own water, grows its own food — and still has decent WiFi.

Written from real Australian conditions (not American fantasies about Montana cabins), this covers everything from solar system sizing to Starlink installation, from rainwater filtration to composting toilets that don't make your guests cry.

### Who It's For

- Tree-changers planning a rural move
- Hobby farmers wanting energy independence
- Regional Australians tired of unreliable power and internet
- Anyone who's Googled "how many solar panels do I need" at 2am

### What You'll Learn

**Part 1 — Power:** Solar panels, batteries, inverters, generators, and how to size a system that actually works for Australian conditions. Real costs, real brands, real installation stories.

**Part 2 — Water:** Rainwater harvesting, filtration, greywater recycling, bore water, and the regulations you need to know state by state.

**Part 3 — Internet & Communication:** Starlink vs NBN vs mobile broadband. What works where, what doesn't, and how to stay connected from the middle of nowhere.

**Part 4 — Food & Garden:** Growing food in Australian conditions, food preservation, automated irrigation, and dealing with everything that wants to eat your garden before you do.

**Part 5 — The Build:** Putting it all together. Budgets, timelines, permits, and the mistakes everyone makes (so you don't have to).
