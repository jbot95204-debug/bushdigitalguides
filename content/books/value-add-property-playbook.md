## What's Inside

The traditional property playbook — buy a house, hope it goes up, buy another one in seven years — is painfully slow. This book is for investors who want to actively create equity, not just wait for it.

Every strategy. Every state's rules. Real numbers, not "indicative estimates." From granny flats to NDIS housing, with honest assessments of what works and what doesn't.

### Who It's For

- Property investors who already own 1-2 properties and want to accelerate
- Anyone considering a granny flat, duplex, or subdivision
- Investors who want real data instead of seminar hype
- People who've been burned by spruikers and want the unvarnished truth

### What You'll Learn

**Part 1 — Foundations:** The mindset shift, understanding zoning (the 30 minutes that saves $100,000), feasibility studies with real templates, and assembling your team of 15 professionals.

**Part 2 — Low-Risk Strategies:** Granny flats (complete state-by-state rules for 2026, including recent reforms), cosmetic renovations and the overcapitalisation trap.

**Part 3 — Medium-Complexity:** Minor subdivisions (Torrens vs strata vs community title), dual occupancy and duplex builds with three real case studies — including one that lost money.

**Part 4 — High-Reward:** Rooming houses (the cash flow king with a reality check), NDIS/SDA housing (brutally honest about the oversupply crisis), Airbnb (the regulatory crackdown you need to know about), and creative income strategies that can stack $107k from a single address.

**Part 5 — The Big Picture:** Where to invest in 2026 (full Cotality market data), tax strategy (CGT, depreciation, GST margin scheme, trusts), and protecting your investment.

### The NDIS Chapter Everyone Needs to Read

We didn't sugarcoat the NDIS section. The market has flipped from undersupply to oversupply. The utilisation rate is stuck at 42%. There have been fraud cases totalling hundreds of millions of dollars. If you're considering SDA housing, read Chapter 10 before you sign anything.
