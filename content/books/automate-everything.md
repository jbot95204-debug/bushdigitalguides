## What's Inside

You didn't start a business to become a professional email-replier. But here you are — chasing invoices at 10pm, losing customers because you forgot to send the quote, and wondering where your weekend went.

This book fixes that. Not with vague AI hype or enterprise software you can't afford, but with practical tools that Australian small businesses can set up on a Saturday arvo.

### Who It's For

- Tradies running solo or with a small crew
- Consultants stuck in feast-or-famine cycles
- Small business owners spending more time on admin than actual work
- Anyone who's ever sent 47 duplicate invoices by accident (that's a real story, and it's in the book)

### What You'll Learn

**Part 1 — The Mindset:** Where your time actually goes (not where you think it goes), the automation stack explained in plain English, and how to audit your time leaks.

**Part 2 — The Tools:** ServiceM8, Xero, Tradify, Zapier, Make, n8n — honest reviews of what works for Australian businesses. Plus communication automation, financial automation, and AI assistants that aren't just chatbots.

**Part 3 — Getting It Done:** The weekend automation sprint. What to automate first, what NOT to automate, and how to maintain your systems once they're running.

### The $47k Story

One bloke showed his boss what he'd built over a few months. Nothing flashy — just connecting systems and removing manual steps. His boss looked at the numbers: "In 4 hours I have saved you 47k a year — that's an additional warehouse worker I found you."

That's not hype. That's just paying attention to what can be automated.
