## What's Inside

Australia is one of the driest inhabited continents on Earth. Adelaide gets less rain than London. And yet we keep watering our gardens with the sophistication of a bloke with a thumb over a hose.

This book changes that. From smart irrigation controllers that check the weather forecast and skip watering when rain's coming, to soil moisture sensors that tell you exactly when your tomatoes are thirsty, to complete Home Assistant setups that run your entire garden automatically.

### Who It's For

- Australian gardeners tired of hand-watering
- Tech-curious people who want to automate their backyard
- Water-conscious Australians who want every drop to count
- Anyone who's killed a plant by forgetting to water it (or overwatering it)

### What You'll Learn

**Part 1 — Why Automate?** The Australian water problem, what automated gardening actually means, and why it's not just for tech nerds.

**Part 2 — Water:** Drip irrigation, smart controllers (Hydrawise, B-hyve, Netro compared), soil moisture sensors, rainwater tank integration, greywater systems.

**Part 3 — Beyond Water:** Automated feeding, greenhouse climate control, grow lights, pest management.

**Part 4 — DIY Smart Garden:** Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, Home Assistant integration, solar-powered garden tech, budget builds under $200.

**Part 5 — Growing Smarter:** Seasonal planting guides by climate zone, wicking beds (with corrected cost data), native and drought-hardy gardens, vertical and small-space automation.

**Part 6 — Real Talk:** What I wish someone told me, maintenance schedules, and the best Australian gardening communities.
