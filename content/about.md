## The Short Version

We write practical guides for Australians. No filler. No corporate speak. Just stuff that actually helps.

## The Slightly Longer Version

Bush Digital Guides started because we were tired of reading books that promised everything and delivered nothing. You know the type — 200 pages that could've been a blog post, padded with motivational quotes and "mindset" chapters that say the same thing five different ways.

We decided to write the books we wished existed. Books packed with real data, real product comparisons, real Australian prices, and real stories from people who've actually done the thing.

### What Makes Our Books Different

**📊 Real data, properly sourced.** Every statistic in our books has an attribution. CoreLogic for property data. Bureau of Meteorology for climate data. ABS for population stats. If we can't source it, we don't print it.

**🇦🇺 Written for Australia.** Not adapted from American content with "metres" swapped in for "feet." Our books reference Australian products, Australian regulations, Australian prices, and Australian conditions. State-by-state where it matters.

**💬 Community voices included.** We've trawled Reddit, Whirlpool, PropertyChat, Home Assistant forums, and YouTube to find real experiences from real Australians. Short quotes, properly attributed, used to show what actually happens — not just what the marketing material promises.

**⚖️ Copyright clean.** Every book goes through a copyright scan. Quotes are attributed. Data is sourced. Case studies are composited and anonymised. We take this seriously because our readers deserve to trust what they're reading.

**🔍 Proofread to death.** Every calculation checked. Every cross-reference verified. Every claim fact-checked. We've found and fixed errors that other publishers would ship.

### The Library So Far
