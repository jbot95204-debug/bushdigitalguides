If you've been anywhere near the news this past fortnight, you'll have noticed something big brewing: the federal government is openly floating changes to the capital gains tax discount. For the first time in years, senior Labor figures aren't shutting down the conversation — they're leaning into it.

For property investors, particularly those of us running value-add strategies, this could be a genuine game-changer. So let's cut through the political noise and figure out what's actually happening, what it means for your portfolio, and whether you should be panicking or planning.

## What's the CGT Discount and Why Does Everyone Suddenly Care?

Quick refresher. When you sell an investment property (or any asset) that you've held for more than 12 months, you currently get a 50% discount on the capital gain. So if you bought a place for $400,000 and sold it for $600,000, your taxable capital gain isn't $200,000 — it's $100,000. That $100,000 gets added to your taxable income and taxed at your marginal rate.

The Howard government introduced this in 1999, replacing the old indexation method that adjusted gains for inflation. It was simpler, and it was meant to encourage investment.

Twenty-seven years later, the numbers tell a confronting story. According to a fresh Parliamentary Budget Office analysis released in early February 2026, the CGT discount has cost the federal budget $205 billion since 1999. Over the next decade, it's projected to cost another $247 billion — more than double the total cost of the past 25 years combined.

And here's the kicker: the top 1% of income earners — those on more than $362,900 a year — receive nearly 60% of the benefit. Ninety percent of the total flows to the wealthiest 20% of taxpayers. In this financial year alone, the discount costs the budget $21.9 billion.

It doesn't take a political genius to see why Labor is eyeing this off ahead of the May budget.

## What Changes Are Actually Being Considered?

Nothing's been confirmed yet, but here's what's on the table based on Cabinet leaks and public statements:

**The most likely scenario: halving the discount from 50% to 25%.** This was Labor's policy at the 2016 and 2019 elections (they proposed reducing it to 25% for assets purchased after a certain date). The Greens, who are pushing hard via a parliamentary inquiry chaired by Senator Nick McKim, would support this or go further.

**A more cautious option: reducing to 40%.** The Property Council has flagged that a full halving would "sharply curtail residential building activity" and suggests 40% as a less disruptive middle ground.

**Grandfathering provisions.** Almost certainly, any changes would only apply to assets purchased after a specific date. If you already own investment properties, your existing CGT discount would likely be preserved. This is standard practice — the government doesn't want to retrospectively change the rules people made decisions under.

**A tiered model.** One option being discussed would make the discount less generous as your total capital gains increase. This would target portfolio landlords with multiple investment properties while leaving mum-and-dad investors largely untouched.

**Property-specific changes.** The discount currently applies to all assets — shares, property, businesses, even artwork. The government could narrow changes specifically to investment property, leaving share investors alone. This would be politically easier but economically targeted.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has said he's "open" to big ideas on tax reform and will apply a "laser-focus on intergenerational inequity" in Labor's second term.

## Would It Actually Lower House Prices?

This is where it gets complicated, and where the honest answer is: probably not much.

Federal Treasury modelled changes to negative gearing and CGT in 2024 and found that curbing CGT deductions would have *more* impact on lowering house prices than negative gearing changes — but neither policy alone would significantly boost housing supply.

The ABC's analysis put it well: the CGT discount has overcompensated property investors for inflation. Since 1999, inflation has averaged 2.9% per year, but house prices have grown at 6.4% annually. The 50% flat discount was always too generous for property.

However, Australia's housing crisis is fundamentally a supply problem. Construction costs remain elevated, labour shortages persist, housing approvals are stuck near decade-low levels, and KPMG forecasts house prices will still rise 7.7% in 2026 regardless of tax changes.

Professor Steven Rowley from Curtin University nailed it: "Given the housing crisis, politicians need to be seen to be doing something." CGT reform is as much about optics and budget repair as it is about housing affordability.

The Grattan Institute, which supports reform, even accepts that a halving of the discount would lead to fewer new dwellings being built in the short term — the opposite of what the housing market needs right now.

## What This Means for Value-Add Investors

Here's where I reckon value-add investors are actually better positioned than most. Let me explain why.

### 1. Value-Add Strategies Become Relatively More Attractive

If the CGT discount drops, the tax advantage of passive "buy and hold, hope for capital growth" investing shrinks. But value-add investors create their own equity through renovations, subdivisions, granny flats, and development — that manufactured equity is within your control, regardless of what the tax system does.

A duplex conversion or granny flat addition that creates $150,000 in equity still creates $150,000 in equity even with a 25% CGT discount instead of 50%. Yes, you'll pay more tax when you eventually sell, but the fundamental value-add proposition remains strong.

### 2. Hold Strategies Get a Rethink

If the discount drops, the incentive to hold and sell is reduced. This could push more investors toward cash-flow strategies instead of capital-growth-and-sell strategies. Think: build a granny flat, keep the property, collect dual rent. That rental income doesn't care about CGT.

For value-add investors who build equity and then refinance (rather than sell), CGT changes are largely irrelevant. You're accessing your equity through the bank, not triggering a CGT event.

### 3. Grandfathering Creates a Window

If changes are announced in the May budget with a forward start date, there's a window to lock in purchases under the current rules. Properties bought before the cut-off date would retain the 50% discount. This could create a short-term rush of investor activity — particularly in value-add opportunities where the numbers stack up.

### 4. Fewer Competing Investors Could Mean Better Deals

If passive investors pull back from the market because the tax benefits are reduced, that's less competition for you at auction. Historically, when investor activity dips, it creates buying opportunities. The 2019 election scare (which Labor lost) saw investor lending drop sharply in the lead-up — and those who bought during that uncertainty did very well.

## The Practical Maths: Before and After

Let's run the numbers on a typical value-add scenario.

**Scenario:** You buy a house for $500,000, spend $100,000 on a granny flat addition, and sell 3 years later for $750,000.

**Under current rules (50% discount):**
- Capital gain: $750,000 - $600,000 (cost base) = $150,000
- Taxable gain: $75,000 (after 50% discount)
- Tax at 37% marginal rate: ~$27,750

**Under proposed rules (25% discount):**
- Capital gain: $150,000
- Taxable gain: $112,500 (after 25% discount)
- Tax at 37% marginal rate: ~$41,625

**Difference: about $13,875 more in tax.**

That's meaningful but not catastrophic. On a deal that generated $150,000 in equity, you're still walking away with over $100,000 profit after tax. The deal still works — you just keep a bit less.

And if you don't sell? If you refinance instead? Your CGT bill is zero either way.

## What You Should Do Right Now

**Don't panic.** Nothing has been legislated. The May budget is still months away, and even then, changes would likely have a future start date.

**Talk to your accountant.** If you're sitting on properties with large unrealised gains and were planning to sell in the next 12-18 months, it might be worth discussing timing. Selling before any changes take effect could save you real money.

**Double down on cash-flow strategies.** If CGT discounts shrink, the relative value of rental income increases. Properties with granny flats, dual-income potential, or strong rental yields become even more attractive.

**Keep buying good deals.** The fundamentals haven't changed. Australia is massively undersupplied on housing. Construction costs are elevated. Population growth continues. Properties in good locations with value-add potential will keep growing in value regardless of the tax treatment of that growth.

**Consider the refinance-and-hold model.** If you can manufacture equity through renovations or additions and then refinance to pull that equity out tax-free, you sidestep CGT entirely. This has always been a powerful strategy — it just becomes relatively more powerful if CGT discounts shrink.

## The Bottom Line

The CGT discount debate is real, it's happening now, and changes are more likely than they've been at any point since 2019. But for value-add investors, this isn't the end of the world — it might actually play to your strengths.

The investors who'll feel this most are the passive capital-growth chasers who buy, hold, and sell for a lump sum. Value-add investors who create equity, hold for cash flow, and refinance strategically are far less exposed.

As always in property: the deal is the deal. If the numbers work before tax, they'll work after tax. CGT is the icing, not the cake.

Stay sharp, run your numbers, and don't let political noise distract you from good fundamentals.
