There's a particular frustration that comes with staring at brown patches in summer, knowing you forgot to run the sprinklers. Or worse — copping a water bill because the timer ran through a week of rain.

Smart irrigation controllers fix both problems. They connect to weather data, adjust automatically, and let you control everything from your phone. But which one actually works in Australia?

Not American units that technically ship here but have no local weather support — the ones that work with our climate data, our water restrictions, and our conditions. Here are the four worth your money in 2026.

## The Contenders

- **Hunter Hydrawise** (HC and Pro-HC series)
- **Orbit B-hyve** (indoor and outdoor models)
- **Netro Pixie** (the newer cloud-based option)
- **Rain Bird ESP-TM2** with LNK2 WiFi module

Let's break them down honestly.

## Hunter Hydrawise

**Price:** $350–$600 AUD depending on zone count (6, 12, or 36 zones)

If you ask an irrigation professional which smart controller they install, most of them will say Hydrawise. There's a reason for that.

**What it does well:**

Hunter is one of the biggest irrigation manufacturers in the world, and Hydrawise was actually developed in Australia (originally based in Adelaide). That shows in how it handles our conditions.

Weather adjustment is where it shines. It pulls data from nearby BoM stations and calculates evapotranspiration (ET) — how much water your soil is losing to heat and wind — then adjusts schedules automatically. 42-degree week? It waters more. Cool, rainy spell? It skips days. The "predictive watering" feature uses forecast data and is genuinely accurate more often than not.

The app is solid — not flashy, but functional for zones, schedules, and water usage monitoring.

**What's not great:**

Hardware feels a bit dated. Setup can be fiddly if you're not familiar with irrigation terminology. The free plan limits some features — the paid "Enthusiast" plan ($79/year) unlocks everything, which is annoying on top of a premium controller price. WiFi needs decent signal at the controller location — metal meter boxes on the far side of the house may need an extender.

**Who it suits:**

Serious gardeners who want the most accurate weather-based scheduling. Homeowners with larger gardens (6+ zones). Anyone who wants a product that irrigation professionals know and support. If something goes wrong, any irrigator will know how to work on a Hydrawise system.

**Water restrictions compliance:** Hydrawise lets you set watering windows and day restrictions that match your local council's water restriction rules. This is a big deal in summer when restrictions kick in across most of Australia.

## Orbit B-hyve

**Price:** $180–$350 AUD depending on model (indoor 4/8/12 zone, outdoor 6/12 zone)

B-hyve is the value pick, and honestly, it punches above its price point.

**What it does well:**

The B-hyve app is probably the best for non-technical users. Setup wizard asks about your plants and soil, then builds a smart schedule from local weather data. Clean, intuitive interface.

Weather-based scheduling works well via the WeatherSense system, though it won't skip as aggressively as Hydrawise — slightly more water usage but less risk of underwatering. Outdoor models are properly weatherproof. Price is the big win: under $200 for a 4–6 zone system. Half the Hydrawise price.

**What's not great:**

Weather data isn't as granular as Hydrawise — broader approach means slower reaction to microclimates. The algorithm occasionally makes odd decisions (watering during rain). Build quality is a step below Hunter — lighter plastic, fiddlier terminals. Works fine though; it's cosmetic.

**Who it suits:**

Budget-conscious homeowners who want smart features without the premium price. Smaller gardens (4–8 zones). People who want a simple setup without reading a manual.

**Water restrictions compliance:** B-hyve supports watering day and time window restrictions, but setting them up requires a bit more manual configuration than Hydrawise.

## Netro Pixie

**Price:** $200–$280 AUD (6 or 12 zones)

Netro is the newcomer that's built a solid following with a different approach — it's fully cloud-based and uses machine learning to optimise your watering schedule over time.

**What it does well:**

The concept is compelling. Netro's system learns your garden over time. It starts with basic weather-based scheduling, then adjusts based on your soil type, plant types, sun exposure, and — here's the clever bit — how your garden actually responds to watering. The algorithm gets smarter the longer you use it.

Setup is extremely easy. The Pixie hardware is compact and modern-looking. The app is clean and minimal. You tell it what's in each zone, and it builds a schedule. From there, it mostly runs itself.

There's no subscription fee. All the smart features are included, forever. Given that Hydrawise charges for its premium features, this is a genuine differentiator.

Water savings claims from Netro are bold (up to 50% reduction), and while I'd take that with a grain of salt, real users do report meaningful water savings compared to a basic timer.

**What's not great:**

Because it's fully cloud-based, if Netro's servers go down or your internet drops out, your watering stops. There's no local fallback scheduling on the device itself. This is a legitimate concern. Other controllers will continue running their last schedule if they lose internet — the Pixie won't.

The machine learning takes time to dial in. For the first few weeks, the watering schedule might be off — too much in some zones, not enough in others. You need to trust the process and give it time, or manually override while it learns.

Netro is a smaller company than Hunter, Orbit, or Rain Bird. If they go under or discontinue the product, your cloud-dependent controller becomes an expensive paperweight. This isn't fearmongering — it's a real consideration for any cloud-only device.

Australian weather station coverage in Netro's system isn't as comprehensive as Hydrawise. It works well in major metro areas but can be patchy in regional locations.

**Who it suits:**

Tech-savvy gardeners who like the idea of a "set and learn" system. People who don't want to pay subscription fees. Smaller to medium gardens in metro areas with reliable internet.

**Water restrictions compliance:** Netro supports watering restrictions, but the implementation is less mature than Hydrawise or B-hyve.

## Rain Bird ESP-TM2 with LNK2 WiFi Module

**Price:** $300–$500 AUD for the controller + $150–$200 for the LNK2 WiFi module

Rain Bird is the other heavyweight in the irrigation world. The ESP-TM2 is their residential smart controller, and it becomes "smart" when you add the LNK2 WiFi module.

**What it does well:**

The ESP-TM2 hardware is built like a tank. Rain Bird has been making irrigation controllers for decades, and the build quality shows. The terminals are solid, the programming buttons are satisfying, and the whole unit feels like it'll last 15+ years (and it probably will).

With the LNK2 module plugged in, you get app control and weather-based scheduling through the Rain Bird app. The scheduling is reliable and conservative — Rain Bird errs on the side of keeping your garden alive rather than saving every last drop of water.

Rain Bird's product ecosystem is huge. If you use Rain Bird sprinklers, rotors, and valves, everything integrates seamlessly. And finding replacement parts or getting professional support is easy — Rain Bird gear is stocked at every irrigation supplier in the country.

The ESP-TM2 works perfectly fine without the WiFi module. If your internet goes down, the controller continues running its programmed schedule. This is a big advantage over the Netro Pixie.

**What's not great:**

The two-piece setup (controller + WiFi module) feels clunky compared to all-in-one units like Hydrawise or B-hyve. The LNK2 module slots into the controller, which is fine, but it's an extra purchase and an extra thing that can potentially fail.

The Rain Bird app is functional but not as polished as the competition. It does what it needs to do, but the interface feels a generation behind Hydrawise or B-hyve.

Weather-based adjustment exists but isn't as sophisticated as Hydrawise's ET-based system. It uses a simpler "seasonal adjust" approach that changes watering by percentage based on weather conditions.

The total cost (controller + WiFi module) puts it in the same price range as Hydrawise, without quite matching the smart features.

**Who it suits:**

People who already have Rain Bird irrigation equipment and want to add smart control. Homeowners who want bulletproof hardware and aren't fussed about having the best app experience. Regional areas where internet reliability is questionable (the controller works standalone).

**Water restrictions compliance:** Rain Bird supports watering day and time restrictions through standard programming. The smart scheduling won't override restriction settings.

## My Honest Recommendation

If money isn't the primary concern and you want the best weather-based scheduling with strong Australian support, **go Hydrawise**. It's the most proven system, the weather adjustment is the most accurate, and every irrigation professional in the country knows how to work with it.

If you want great smart features without spending a fortune, **B-hyve is the value champion**. The app is beginner-friendly, the scheduling works well, and you'll save $150–200 compared to Hydrawise for a very comparable experience.

If you're tech-curious and like the idea of a learning system with no subscription fees, **give Netro Pixie a look** — but go in with your eyes open about the cloud dependency.

If you want something that'll survive the apocalypse and keep your garden alive regardless of internet status, **Rain Bird ESP-TM2** is your pick. It's overbuilt in the best way.

## Beyond the Controller

Here's the thing — a smart controller is just one piece of the puzzle. The real magic in garden automation happens when you combine your controller with soil moisture sensors, rain sensors, flow meters, and properly designed irrigation zones.

A smart controller adjusting based on weather data is good. A smart controller adjusting based on weather data *and* actual soil moisture readings from your garden beds? That's genuinely set-and-forget.

If you want to go the whole hog with garden automation — integrating sensors, setting up proper zones, automating fertilising schedules, and building a system that genuinely runs itself — I cover all of it in [Set and Forget: The Aussie Guide to Automated Gardening](/books/set-and-forget/). It walks you through the full sensor integration setup, not just the controller piece.

## Final Thought

Any smart controller is better than a dumb timer or (worse) hand-watering that you forget about. If you're still running a mechanical timer from Bunnings, upgrading to any of these four options will save you water, save you time, and give you a healthier garden.

Pick the one that fits your budget and technical comfort level. Install it on a weekend. And then enjoy the satisfaction of watching your garden thrive while you do absolutely nothing.

That's the dream, isn't it?
