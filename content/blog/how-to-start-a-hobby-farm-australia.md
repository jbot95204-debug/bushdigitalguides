Dreaming of wide paddocks, a chook pen out the back, and rows of fresh vegies you grew yourself? You're not alone. The hobby farm movement in Australia has exploded over the past few years, fuelled by rising food costs, a growing appetite for self-sufficiency, and the shift to remote work making a tree-change genuinely possible.

But there's a gap between the daydream and actually doing it. This guide walks you through the real steps to getting your hobby farm off the ground — from finding the right land to keeping everything running without burning out.

## What Exactly Is a Hobby Farm?

A hobby farm is a small-scale farm — typically under 20 hectares — where the primary goal isn't commercial profit. You might sell surplus eggs, fruit, or honey at a local market, but the main driver is lifestyle: growing your own food, keeping animals, and living closer to the land.

Legally, the ATO distinguishes between a hobby and a business based on whether you're operating with a genuine profit intention. If you're just growing for yourself and selling a few boxes of tomatoes, you're a hobbyist. If you start turning a consistent profit, you may need an ABN and to report that income.

## Step 1: Choose Your Land Wisely

This is the biggest decision you'll make. Here's what to look for:

- **Water access**: Bore water, dam, creek frontage, or reliable rainfall. Without water, nothing else matters. Check the Bureau of Meteorology's historical rainfall data for the area.
- **Soil quality**: Sandy, clay, loam — each has trade-offs. Get a soil test before you buy. Your local Landcare group can point you to testing services.
- **Zoning**: Check with your local council that the land is zoned for rural or agricultural use. Some peri-urban blocks have restrictions on livestock numbers, outbuildings, or water bore drilling.
- **Size**: For a basic hobby farm with vegies, fruit trees, and a few chooks, you can get started on as little as 2–5 acres (about 1–2 hectares). Larger stock like cattle or sheep need 10+ hectares minimum.
- **Grid connection**: Remote properties may not have mains power. This isn't necessarily a problem — off-grid solar systems have come down significantly in cost — but it's something to factor into your budget.

Land prices vary wildly. Peri-urban hobby farm blocks (within 1–2 hours of a capital city) typically range from $300,000 to $800,000+, while more remote acreages can be found from $150,000. Broadacre farmland averages around $4,000–$5,000 per hectare nationally, though small hobby-sized blocks carry a premium per hectare.

## Step 2: Start Small — Really Small

The number one mistake new hobby farmers make is trying to do everything at once. You don't need goats, bees, an orchard, a vegie garden, and a dam full of yabbies in year one. Pick two or three things and do them well.

A solid starting combination:

1. **A vegie garden** — Raised beds or no-dig beds are the fastest way to start producing food. They work on poor soil, are easier on your back, and can be set up in a weekend.
2. **Chickens** — Six to ten laying hens will keep a family in eggs and help with pest control. Check local council limits.
3. **Fruit trees** — Plant these early because they take 2–3 years to produce. Citrus, stone fruit, and figs do well across most of Australia.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Water and Power

### Water

For growing food, you'll need a reliable irrigation setup. Options include:

- **Rainwater tanks** — A 22,500L tank is a good starting point. Budget $2,000–$4,000 installed.
- **Bore water** — Can cost $5,000–$15,000 to drill, but provides a reliable year-round supply.
- **Dam** — If your property has the right contour, a farm dam is a fantastic asset. Council permits may be required.

**Pro tip**: Automate your irrigation from the start. Smart irrigation controllers connected to soil moisture sensors can cut your water usage by 30–50% and save you hours of manual watering each week. For a full walkthrough of setting up automated watering systems — including drip irrigation, timers, and soil sensors — grab a copy of [*Set and Forget: The Automated Gardening Guide*](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GN3RYDSC) on Amazon.

### Power

If you're on-grid, you're sorted. If you're remote or want energy independence, a standalone solar system is the go. A basic off-grid setup (5kW solar + 10kWh battery + inverter) starts around $20,000–$30,000 for a small property. Larger systems for a full household run $35,000–$60,000.

## Step 4: Think About Livestock

If you're going beyond chooks, here's a rough guide:

| Animal | Min. Land Needed | Startup Cost | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Chickens (10) | Small pen + run | $500–$1,000 | Easiest livestock. Great for beginners. |
| Goats (2–4) | 1+ hectare | $800–$2,000 | Excellent for clearing lantana and blackberry. Need good fencing. |
| Sheep (small flock) | 2+ hectares | $1,000–$3,000 | Wiltipoll or Dorper breeds are low-maintenance. |
| Cattle (2–3) | 5+ hectares | $3,000–$8,000 | Requires proper fencing, water, and handling yards. |
| Bees (2 hives) | Anywhere | $1,000–$2,000 | Check for Varroa mite management requirements in your state. |

## Step 5: Automate What You Can

Here's where modern hobby farming differs from your grandparents' version. Technology can take the drudgery out of daily tasks:

- **Automatic chicken coop doors** — Solar-powered doors that open at dawn and close at dusk. No more forgetting to lock the chooks in.
- **Smart irrigation** — Drip systems on timers with soil moisture sensors. Water only when and where it's needed.
- **Weather stations** — A basic home weather station helps you plan planting, watering, and harvesting.
- **Solar-powered electric fencing** — Keep stock in and foxes out without running mains power to the paddock.

The key philosophy is "set and forget" — invest time upfront building good systems so you're not a slave to daily chores. Both [*Set and Forget*](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GN3RYDSC) and [*Off-Grid but Online*](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GMVBDWJR) dig deep into this approach.

## Step 6: Know the Legal Stuff

Before you jump in:

- **Council permits**: You may need development approvals for sheds, dams, or livestock shelters.
- **Biosecurity**: Register with your state's biosecurity authority if keeping livestock. Property Identification Codes (PICs) are mandatory for cattle, sheep, and goats.
- **Water licences**: Some states require licences for bore water extraction or dam construction.
- **Insurance**: Standard home insurance may not cover farm structures, livestock, or liability for visitors. Talk to a rural insurance broker.

## Getting Started This Weekend

You don't need 50 acres to begin. If you've got a suburban backyard, start with a no-dig raised bed and a few herb seedlings. If you've already got land, pick your easiest win — maybe it's six chooks and a rainwater tank — and build from there.

The best hobby farms grow organically (in every sense). Start small, learn as you go, and add new projects each season.
