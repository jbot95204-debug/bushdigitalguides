For the first time in years, senior Labor figures aren&rsquo;t shutting down the conversation — they&rsquo;re leaning into it.</p><p>For property investors, particularly those of us running value-add strategies, this could be a genuine game-changer. So let&rsquo;s cut through the political noise and figure out what&rsquo;s actually happening, what it means for your portfolio, and whether you should be panicking or planning.</p><h2 id=whats-the-cgt-discount-and-why-does-everyone-suddenly-care>What&rsquo;s the CGT Discount and Why Does Everyone Suddenly Care?</h2><p>Quick refresher. When you sell an investment property (or any asset) that you&rsquo;ve held for more than 12 months, you currently get a 50% discount on the capital gain. So if you bought a place for $400,000 and sold it for $600,000, your taxable capital gain isn&rsquo;t $200,000 — it&rsquo;s $100,000. That $100,000 gets added to your taxable income and taxed at your marginal rate.</p><p>The Howard government introduced this in 1999, replacing the old indexation method that adjusted gains for inflation. It was simpler, and it was meant to encourage investment.</p><p>Twenty-seven years later, the numbers tell a confronting story. According to a fresh Parliamentary Budget Office analysis released in early February 2026, the CGT discount has cost the federal budget $205 billion since 1999. Over the next decade, it&rsquo;s projected to cost another $247 billion — more than double the total cost of the past 25 years combined.</p><p>And here&rsquo;s the kicker: the top 1% of income earners — those on more than $362,900 a year — receive nearly 60% of the benefit. Ninety percent of the total flows to the wealthiest 20% of taxpayers. In this financial year alone, the discount costs the budget $21.9 billion.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a political genius to see why Labor is eyeing this off ahead of the May budget.</p><h2 id=what-changes-are-actually-being-considered>What Changes Are Actually Being Considered?</h2><p>Nothing&rsquo;s been confirmed yet, but here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s on the table based on Cabinet leaks and public statements:</p><p><strong>The most likely scenario: halving the discount from 50% to 25%.</strong> This was Labor&rsquo;s policy at the 2016 and 2019 elections (they proposed reducing it to 25% for assets purchased after a certain date). The Greens, who are pushing hard via a parliamentary inquiry chaired by Senator Nick McKim, would support this or go further.</p><p><strong>A more cautious option: reducing to 40%.</strong> The Property Council has flagged that a full halving would &ldquo;sharply curtail residential building activity&rdquo; and suggests 40% as a less disruptive middle ground.</p><p><strong>Grandfathering provisions.</strong> Almost certainly, any changes would only apply to assets purchased after a specific date. If you already own investment properties, your existing CGT discount would likely be preserved. This is standard practice — the government doesn&rsquo;t want to retrospectively change the rules people made decisions under.</p><p><strong>A tiered model.</strong> One option being discussed would make the discount less generous as your total capital gains increase. This would target portfolio landlords with multiple investment properties while leaving mum-and-dad investors largely untouched.</p><p><strong>Property-specific changes.</strong> The discount currently applies to all assets — shares, property, businesses, even artwork. The government could narrow changes specifically to investment property, leaving share investors alone. This would be politically easier but economically targeted.</p><p>Treasurer Jim Chalmers has said he&rsquo;s &ldquo;open&rdquo; to big ideas on tax reform and will apply a &ldquo;laser-focus on intergenerational inequity&rdquo; in Labor&rsquo;s second term.</p><h2 id=would-it-actually-lower-house-prices>Would It Actually Lower House Prices?</h2><p>This is where it gets complicated, and where the honest answer is: probably not much.</p><p>Federal Treasury modelled changes to negative gearing and CGT in 2024 and found that curbing CGT deductions would have <em>more</em> impact on lowering house prices than negative gearing changes — but neither policy alone would significantly boost housing supply.</p><p>The ABC&rsquo;s analysis put it well: the CGT discount has overcompensated property investors for inflation. Since 1999, inflation has averaged 2.9% per year, but house prices have grown at 6.4% annually. The 50% flat discount was always too generous for property.</p><p>However, Australia&rsquo;s housing crisis is fundamentally a supply problem. Construction costs remain elevated, labour shortages persist, housing approvals are stuck near decade-low levels, and KPMG forecasts house prices will still rise 7.7% in 2026 regardless of tax changes.</p><p>Professor Steven Rowley from Curtin University nailed it: &ldquo;Given the housing crisis, politicians need to be seen to be doing something.&rdquo; CGT reform is as much about optics and budget repair as it is about housing affordability.</p><p>The Grattan Institute, which supports reform, even accepts that a halving of the discount would lead to fewer new dwellings being built in the short term — the opposite of what the housing market needs right now.</p><h2 id=what-this-means-for-value-add-investors>What This Means for Value-Add Investors</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s where I reckon value-add investors are actually better positioned than most. Let me explain why.</p><h3 id=1-value-add-strategies-become-relatively-more-attractive>1. Value-Add Strategies Become Relatively More Attractive</h3><p>If the CGT discount drops, the tax advantage of passive &ldquo;buy and hold, hope for capital growth&rdquo; investing shrinks. But value-add investors create their own equity through renovations, subdivisions, granny flats, and development — that manufactured equity is within your control, regardless of what the tax system does.</p><p>A duplex conversion or granny flat addition that creates $150,000 in equity still creates $150,000 in equity even with a 25% CGT discount instead of 50%. Yes, you&rsquo;ll pay more tax when you eventually sell, but the fundamental value-add proposition remains strong.</p><h3 id=2-hold-strategies-get-a-rethink>2. Hold Strategies Get a Rethink</h3><p>If the discount drops, the incentive to hold and sell is reduced. This could push more investors toward cash-flow strategies instead of capital-growth-and-sell strategies. Think: build a granny flat, keep the property, collect dual rent. That rental income doesn&rsquo;t care about CGT.</p><p>For value-add investors who build equity and then refinance (rather than sell), CGT changes are largely irrelevant. You&rsquo;re accessing your equity through the bank, not triggering a CGT event.</p><h3 id=3-grandfathering-creates-a-window>3. Grandfathering Creates a Window</h3><p>If changes are announced in the May budget with a forward start date, there&rsquo;s a window to lock in purchases under the current rules. Properties bought before the cut-off date would retain the 50% discount. This could create a short-term rush of investor activity — particularly in value-add opportunities where the numbers stack up.</p><h3 id=4-fewer-competing-investors-could-mean-better-deals>4. Fewer Competing Investors Could Mean Better Deals</h3><p>If passive investors pull back from the market because the tax benefits are reduced, that&rsquo;s less competition for you at auction. Historically, when investor activity dips, it creates buying opportunities. The 2019 election scare (which Labor lost) saw investor lending drop sharply in the lead-up — and those who bought during that uncertainty did very well.</p><h2 id=the-practical-maths-before-and-after>The Practical Maths: Before and After</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s run the numbers on a typical value-add scenario.</p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You buy a house for $500,000, spend $100,000 on a granny flat addition, and sell 3 years later for $750,000.</p><p><strong>Under current rules (50% discount):</strong></p><ul><li>Capital gain: $750,000 - $600,000 (cost base) = $150,000</li><li>Taxable gain: $75,000 (after 50% discount)</li><li>Tax at 37% marginal rate: ~$27,750</li></ul><p><strong>Under proposed rules (25% discount):</strong></p><ul><li>Capital gain: $150,000</li><li>Taxable gain: $112,500 (after 25% discount)</li><li>Tax at 37% marginal rate: ~$41,625</li></ul><p><strong>Difference: about $13,875 more in tax.</strong></p><p>That&rsquo;s meaningful but not catastrophic. On a deal that generated $150,000 in equity, you&rsquo;re still walking away with over $100,000 profit after tax. The deal still works — you just keep a bit less.</p><p>And if you don&rsquo;t sell? If you refinance instead? Your CGT bill is zero either way.</p><h2 id=what-you-should-do-right-now>What You Should Do Right Now</h2><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t panic.</strong> Nothing has been legislated. The May budget is still months away, and even then, changes would likely have a future start date.</p><p><strong>Talk to your accountant.</strong> If you&rsquo;re sitting on properties with large unrealised gains and were planning to sell in the next 12-18 months, it might be worth discussing timing. Selling before any changes take effect could save you real money.</p><p><strong>Double down on cash-flow strategies.</strong> If CGT discounts shrink, the relative value of rental income increases. Properties with granny flats, dual-income potential, or strong rental yields become even more attractive.</p><p><strong>Keep buying good deals.</strong> The fundamentals haven&rsquo;t changed. Australia is massively undersupplied on housing. Construction costs are elevated. Population growth continues. Properties in good locations with value-add potential will keep growing in value regardless of the tax treatment of that growth.</p><p><strong>Consider the refinance-and-hold model.</strong> If you can manufacture equity through renovations or additions and then refinance to pull that equity out tax-free, you sidestep CGT entirely. This has always been a powerful strategy — it just becomes relatively more powerful if CGT discounts shrink.</p><h2 id=the-bottom-line>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The CGT discount debate is real, it&rsquo;s happening now, and changes are more likely than they&rsquo;ve been at any point since 2019. But for value-add investors, this isn&rsquo;t the end of the world — it might actually play to your strengths.</p><p>The investors who&rsquo;ll feel this most are the passive capital-growth chasers who buy, hold, and sell for a lump sum. Value-add investors who create equity, hold for cash flow, and refinance strategically are far less exposed.</p><p>As always in property: the deal is the deal. If the numbers work before tax, they&rsquo;ll work after tax. CGT is the icing, not the cake.</p><p>Stay sharp, run your numbers, and don&rsquo;t let political noise distract you from good fundamentals.</p><hr><p><em>This post is general information only and does not constitute financial, tax, or investment advice.
