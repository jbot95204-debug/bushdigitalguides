And just when you think you&rsquo;ve got it sorted, someone on a forum tells you the rules changed again six months ago.</p><p>They&rsquo;re probably right. Granny flat regulations across Australia have been shifting faster than property prices in a boom suburb. Between late 2023 and 2025, almost every state and territory made significant changes — most of them making it <em>easier</em> to build. That&rsquo;s the good news.</p><p>The bad news? The details still trip people up. And getting it wrong can cost you tens of thousands of dollars, or worse, a council demolition order.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the honest, updated breakdown of granny flat rules Australia 2026, state by state.</p><h2 id=first-up-cdc-vs-da-and-why-it-matters>First Up: CDC vs DA (and Why It Matters)</h2><p>Before we get into the states, you need to understand the two main approval pathways.</p><p><strong>Complying Development Certificate (CDC)</strong> — This is the fast track. If your granny flat meets specific criteria (size, setbacks, lot size, bushfire zone, etc.), a private certifier can approve it without it going to council. Typical turnaround: 10–20 business days. No neighbour notification, no planner&rsquo;s discretion.</p><p><strong>Development Application (DA)</strong> — This is the traditional council approval route. You lodge plans, council assesses them against their local planning controls, neighbours might get notified, and a planner makes a judgment call. Turnaround: 40–90+ business days, depending on the council and whether they request additional information (they almost always do).</p><p>The CDC pathway is faster, cheaper, and more predictable. But it comes with strict rules. Go one centimetre over a setback or one square metre over the size limit, and you&rsquo;re into DA territory.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker most people miss: <strong>not every property qualifies for CDC</strong>. Flood zones, heritage areas, bushfire-prone land, and certain environmental overlays can knock you out of CDC eligibility entirely. Always check your property&rsquo;s planning constraints before you get excited about a 20-day approval.</p><h2 id=new-south-wales>New South Wales</h2><p>NSW is still the king of granny flats. They&rsquo;ve had the most established CDC pathway since 2009, and the rules are well understood by builders and certifiers.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area: <strong>60 square metres</strong> (this is internal area, not including porches or carports, though check the specific measurement rules)</li><li>Minimum lot size: <strong>450 square metres</strong></li><li>One granny flat per lot</li><li>Must be on the same lot as an existing dwelling (or proposed as part of a dual-occupancy build)</li><li>Can be rented to <strong>anyone</strong> — no family member restriction</li><li>CDC pathway available via the State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes)</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in NSW:</strong></p><ul><li>The 60sqm limit catches people out when they include a covered alfresco or carport without checking what counts towards the floor area calculation</li><li>Strata-titled properties generally can&rsquo;t have a granny flat under CDC</li><li>Some councils have local provisions that restrict granny flats beyond the state rules — always check the LEP and DCP</li><li>Bushfire-prone land (BAL-40 and above) is excluded from CDC</li></ul><p>NSW remains the gold standard for granny flat feasibility. If you&rsquo;re buying specifically for a granny flat value-add strategy, the certainty of the NSW CDC pathway is hard to beat.</p><h2 id=victoria>Victoria</h2><p>Victoria went through a massive shake-up with the introduction of <strong>VC253</strong> in December 2023. This was the reform that finally brought Victoria into the modern granny flat era.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area varies by zone and lot size, but generally up to <strong>60 square metres</strong></li><li>No planning permit required for a single &ldquo;small second dwelling&rdquo; on lots in the General Residential Zone, Neighbourhood Residential Zone, and Residential Growth Zone</li><li>The dwelling must be on the same lot as an existing home</li><li>Can be rented to anyone — the old &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; restriction is gone</li><li>Must comply with the Building Code and relevant building regulations</li></ul><p><strong>What VC253 actually changed:</strong>
Before December 2023, building a granny flat in Victoria was a nightmare. You needed a planning permit, council had broad discretion to refuse, and the rules varied wildly between municipalities. The reform removed the planning permit requirement for compliant small second dwellings, bringing Victoria closer to the NSW model.</p><p><strong>Common traps in Victoria:</strong></p><ul><li>The reform didn&rsquo;t eliminate <em>all</em> planning overlays — heritage, environmental, and special building overlays can still require a permit</li><li>Size limits and setback requirements vary depending on the zone and lot size</li><li>Many Victorian lots are narrower than their NSW counterparts, making setback compliance trickier</li><li>The reform is still relatively new, and some councils and building surveyors are still getting their heads around the implementation</li></ul><h2 id=queensland>Queensland</h2><p>Queensland made a game-changing move in <strong>September 2022</strong> when they removed the requirement that secondary dwellings could only be rented to family members. You can now rent your granny flat to anyone.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area: <strong>80 square metres</strong> (one of the more generous limits nationally)</li><li>Minimum lot size varies by council, but typically <strong>450 square metres</strong></li><li>Accepted development (the QLD equivalent of CDC) is available in many areas</li><li>Can be rented to <strong>anyone</strong> since September 2022</li><li>Must be associated with a primary dwelling on the same lot</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in Queensland:</strong></p><ul><li>While the state removed the family restriction, some local council planning schemes have additional provisions — always check your specific council</li><li>Queensland&rsquo;s building requirements for cyclone regions (north of the Tropic of Capricorn) add significant cost</li><li>Infrastructure charges can be substantial in some council areas — get a quote before committing</li><li>The 80sqm limit is generous, but be aware it&rsquo;s measured differently to NSW</li></ul><p>Queensland&rsquo;s combination of generous size limits and no rental restrictions makes it one of the best states for granny flat investment.</p><h2 id=western-australia>Western Australia</h2><p>WA made headlines in <strong>April 2024</strong> when they removed the minimum lot size requirement for ancillary dwellings. Before this, you generally needed 450sqm or more. Now, the focus is on meeting setback and open space requirements rather than hitting a specific lot size threshold.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area: <strong>70 square metres</strong></li><li><strong>No minimum lot size</strong> (as of April 2024), but must meet setback and open space requirements</li><li>Can be rented to anyone</li><li>Must be ancillary to the primary dwelling</li><li>Approval pathway varies by local government area</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in WA:</strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;No minimum lot size&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean every small lot will work — you still need to meet setbacks, open space ratios, and car parking requirements</li><li>Some local governments have additional scheme provisions</li><li>WA&rsquo;s planning system varies more between councils than in NSW or QLD</li><li>Services connections (sewer, water, power) can be expensive, especially for subdivided or infill lots</li></ul><h2 id=south-australia>South Australia</h2><p>SA made a welcome change in <strong>November 2024</strong>, increasing the maximum granny flat size from 60sqm to <strong>70 square metres</strong>. This was part of broader housing reforms aimed at increasing housing supply.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area: <strong>70 square metres</strong> (increased from 60sqm in November 2024)</li><li>Must be on the same allotment as an existing dwelling</li><li>Can be rented to anyone</li><li>Planning approval pathway under the Planning and Design Code</li><li>Setbacks and site coverage rules apply</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in SA:</strong></p><ul><li>SA&rsquo;s Planning and Design Code is relatively new (replaced the old council-by-council development plans), and some provisions are still being tested</li><li>Character areas and heritage zones can restrict or prevent secondary dwellings</li><li>The 70sqm limit is internal floor area — make sure your designer measures it correctly</li><li>Some areas have minimum lot size requirements that effectively prevent granny flats on smaller blocks</li></ul><p>The bump to 70sqm is a meaningful improvement — it&rsquo;s the difference between a liveable one-bedroom and a cramped studio.</p><h2 id=tasmania>Tasmania</h2><p>Tasmania has been growing fast, and granny flat rules have been updated to help with housing supply.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area: <strong>60 square metres</strong></li><li>Must comply with the Tasmanian Planning Scheme</li><li>Can be rented to anyone</li><li>Setback and site coverage requirements apply</li><li>Some fast-track approval options available</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in Tasmania:</strong></p><ul><li>Tasmania&rsquo;s bushfire-prone land mapping covers a significant portion of the state, which can complicate approvals</li><li>Heritage areas (especially in Hobart) restrict secondary dwellings</li><li>Services and infrastructure can be limited in regional areas</li><li>Smaller lot sizes in older suburbs can make compliance challenging</li></ul><h2 id=act>ACT</h2><p>The ACT has some of the most flexible size rules, but also some unique restrictions.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Floor area range: <strong>40 to 90 square metres</strong> (depending on the block size and zone)</li><li>Must be on the same block as an existing dwelling</li><li>Lease variation may be required (this is a unique ACT requirement due to the leasehold land system)</li><li>Can be rented to anyone</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in ACT:</strong></p><ul><li>The lease variation process can be expensive and time-consuming — it&rsquo;s essentially a fee to change the permitted use of your land</li><li>The wide size range (40–90sqm) depends on your specific block and zone, so don&rsquo;t assume you can build to 90sqm</li><li>The ACT&rsquo;s leasehold system adds a layer of complexity that doesn&rsquo;t exist in other states</li></ul><h2 id=northern-territory>Northern Territory</h2><p>The NT updated its rules in <strong>December 2023</strong> to allow larger secondary dwellings and streamline the approval process.</p><p><strong>Key rules:</strong></p><ul><li>Maximum floor area: <strong>75 square metres</strong> (as of December 2023)</li><li>Must be on the same lot as an existing dwelling</li><li>Can be rented to anyone</li><li>Approval through the NT planning system</li></ul><p><strong>Common traps in NT:</strong></p><ul><li>Darwin&rsquo;s cyclone building requirements add significant cost (similar to North Queensland)</li><li>Some areas have limited services infrastructure</li><li>The smaller population means fewer experienced granny flat builders</li><li>Soil conditions in some areas require more extensive foundations</li></ul><h2 id=the-traps-that-catch-everyone>The Traps That Catch Everyone</h2><p>Regardless of which state you&rsquo;re in, these are the issues that trip up first-timers:</p><p><strong>1. Not checking planning constraints first.</strong> Before you spend a cent on designs, check your property for flood zones, bushfire ratings, heritage overlays, contaminated land registers, and easements. Any of these can kill a project or push you into a more expensive approval pathway.</p><p><strong>2. Underestimating costs.</strong> A basic granny flat build in 2026 is running $150,000–$250,000+ depending on size, finish level, and site conditions. Add $20,000–$50,000 for site works, services, and approvals. The &ldquo;$100k granny flat&rdquo; you saw advertised is marketing fiction.</p><p><strong>3. Ignoring services.</strong> Sewer connections alone can cost $10,000–$30,000 depending on your distance from the main. Stormwater, electrical upgrades, and water connections add up. Get real quotes, not estimates.</p><p><strong>4. Not understanding the rental market.</strong> A granny flat in a location where there&rsquo;s no rental demand is just an expensive pool house. Research rental yields for secondary dwellings in your specific area before committing.</p><p><strong>5. Forgetting about ongoing costs.</strong> Council rates may increase, landlord insurance is needed, property management fees apply if you don&rsquo;t self-manage, and maintenance is your responsibility.</p><h2 id=making-the-numbers-work>Making the Numbers Work</h2><p>The real money in granny flats isn&rsquo;t just the rental income — it&rsquo;s the equity uplift. A well-built granny flat on the right property can add more value than it costs to build. But &ldquo;the right property&rdquo; is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re serious about using granny flats as part of a property investment strategy, you need to run proper feasibility numbers — not back-of-envelope calculations. That means understanding your total project cost, realistic rental income, the impact on your property&rsquo;s valuation, and how it fits into your broader investment plan.</p><p>I go deep on granny flat feasibility analysis in <a href=/books/value-add-property-playbook/>The Value-Add Property Playbook</a>, including how to run the numbers before you commit, what to look for in a property that&rsquo;s suitable for a granny flat build, and how to avoid the common mistakes that turn a good investment into an expensive lesson.</p><h2 id=the-bottom-line>The Bottom Line</h2><p>2026 is genuinely one of the best times to be considering a granny flat in Australia. Every state has moved towards making them easier to build and more flexible to use. But easier doesn&rsquo;t mean easy, and the devil is absolutely in the details.</p><p>Do your homework. Check your specific property&rsquo;s constraints. Run the numbers properly. And don&rsquo;t trust anyone who tells you it&rsquo;s simple — it&rsquo;s straightforward when you know what you&rsquo;re doing, but there are enough traps to catch the unprepared.</p><p>Good luck with the build.</p><div class=post-book-cta><div class=emoji>📚</div><div><strong>Want the full picture?</strong>
