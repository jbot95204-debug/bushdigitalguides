This guide gives you the <strong>real duplex build costs in Australia for 2026</strong> — construction costs per square metre, the hidden costs nobody talks about upfront, actual case studies from recent builds, and the financing realities you need to plan for.</p><p>No fluff. No &ldquo;contact us for a quote&rdquo; gatekeeping. Just the numbers.</p><h2 id=construction-costs-per-square-metre-2026-reality>Construction Costs Per Square Metre: 2026 Reality</h2><p>The headline number everyone wants is the cost per square metre. Here&rsquo;s where it sits in 2026:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Build Quality</th><th>Cost per m²</th><th>What You Get</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Budget/Basic</strong></td><td>$2,000-$2,500</td><td>Standard finishes, basic fixtures, project-home level</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mid-Range</strong></td><td>$2,500-$3,200</td><td>Good quality finishes, stone benchtops, decent fixtures</td></tr><tr><td><strong>High-End</strong></td><td>$3,200-$3,800+</td><td>Premium finishes, custom design, high-spec everything</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These figures are for the <strong>construction cost only</strong> — the actual building. They don&rsquo;t include land, demolition, council fees, professional fees, landscaping, or any of the other costs that add up fast.</p><h3 id=why-the-range-is-so-wide>Why the Range Is So Wide</h3><p>The spread from $2,000 to $3,800 per square metre isn&rsquo;t just about quality. It&rsquo;s driven by:</p><ul><li><strong>Location</strong> — Building in Sydney or Melbourne costs more than regional areas (labour costs, site access, council requirements)</li><li><strong>Site conditions</strong> — Sloping blocks, reactive soil, rock, and poor drainage all add costs</li><li><strong>Design complexity</strong> — A simple rectangular footprint is much cheaper than architecturally designed angles and curves</li><li><strong>Builder availability</strong> — When builders are busy (which they are in 2026), prices go up. Simple economics.</li><li><strong>Finishes</strong> — The gap between laminate and Caesarstone benchtops, between builder-grade tapware and premium fixtures, adds up across two entire dwellings</li></ul><h2 id=the-hidden-costs-185000-416000-beyond-the-build>The Hidden Costs: $185,000-$416,000 Beyond the Build</h2><p>This is where most duplex cost articles completely fall over. The construction cost is only part of the story. Here&rsquo;s everything else:</p><h3 id=pre-construction-costs>Pre-Construction Costs</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Cost Item</th><th>Typical Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Demolition (existing dwelling)</td><td>$15,000-$45,000</td></tr><tr><td>Survey</td><td>$2,000-$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Geotechnical report (soil testing)</td><td>$2,500-$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Architectural/drafting</td><td>$15,000-$40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Town planner</td><td>$5,000-$15,000</td></tr><tr><td>DA/CDC application fees</td><td>$5,000-$20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Engineering (structural + civil)</td><td>$8,000-$20,000</td></tr><tr><td>BASIX/energy compliance</td><td>$2,000-$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Subdivision costs (surveyor + council)</td><td>$15,000-$40,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pre-construction subtotal</strong></td><td><strong>$69,500-$195,000</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=during-construction-extras>During Construction Extras</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Cost Item</th><th>Typical Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Site preparation (cut/fill, retaining)</td><td>$10,000-$50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Service connections (water, sewer, power, gas, data)</td><td>$15,000-$40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Driveways and crossovers</td><td>$10,000-$30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Landscaping (both dwellings)</td><td>$10,000-$30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Fencing</td><td>$5,000-$15,000</td></tr><tr><td>Council contribution fees (s7.11/s7.12 in NSW)</td><td>$10,000-$30,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>During-construction subtotal</strong></td><td><strong>$60,000-$195,000</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=post-construction>Post-Construction</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Cost Item</th><th>Typical Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strata/subdivision registration</td><td>$3,000-$8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation certificate costs</td><td>$2,000-$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Holding costs during build (12-18 months of loan interest)</td><td>$30,000-$60,000+</td></tr><tr><td>Council rates during build</td><td>$2,000-$4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance during construction</td><td>$3,000-$6,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Post-construction subtotal</strong></td><td><strong>$40,000-$83,000</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=total-hidden-costs>Total Hidden Costs</h3><p><strong>$185,000-$416,000</strong> on top of your construction costs.

The margin is there, but it&rsquo;s tighter than most people expect.</p><h3 id=case-study-2-glen-waverley-melbourne>Case Study 2: Glen Waverley, Melbourne</h3><ul><li><strong>Land:</strong> $1,400,000 (650m² lot in established area)</li><li><strong>Demolition:</strong> $28,000</li><li><strong>Design + permits:</strong> $45,000</li><li><strong>Construction:</strong> 2x 4-bed, 2-bath townhouse-style (each 180m² internal) at $3,200/m² = <strong>$1,152,000</strong></li><li><strong>Hidden costs:</strong> $210,000</li><li><strong>Holding costs (16-month build):</strong> $58,000</li><li><strong>Total project cost:</strong> ~$2,893,000</li><li><strong>End values:</strong> $1,500,000-$1,600,000 each = <strong>$3,000,000-$3,200,000</strong></li><li><strong>Gross profit:</strong> $107,000-$307,000</li><li><strong>Net profit:</strong> Roughly $30,000-$180,000</li></ul><p>Higher-value market, but the land cost eats into margins. This is where design and finish quality really matter — you need to hit the top end of the value range to make it worthwhile.</p><h3 id=case-study-3-coorparoo-brisbane>Case Study 3: Coorparoo, Brisbane</h3><ul><li><strong>Land:</strong> $850,000 (600m² lot, character overlay area)</li><li><strong>Demolition:</strong> $18,000 (character facade retention required — adds complexity)</li><li><strong>Design + DA + character overlay compliance:</strong> $55,000</li><li><strong>Construction:</strong> 2x 3-bed, 2-bath (each 150m² internal) at $2,800/m² = <strong>$840,000</strong></li><li><strong>Hidden costs:</strong> $155,000</li><li><strong>Holding costs (13-month build):</strong> $38,000</li><li><strong>Total project cost:</strong> ~$1,956,000</li><li><strong>End values:</strong> $1,100,000-$1,200,000 each = <strong>$2,200,000-$2,400,000</strong></li><li><strong>Gross profit:</strong> $244,000-$444,000</li><li><strong>Net profit:</strong> Roughly $130,000-$280,000</li></ul><p>Brisbane in 2026 still offers arguably the best duplex margins of the three major east-coast capitals, particularly in inner-city suburbs where land is cheaper relative to end values than Sydney or Melbourne.</p><h2 id=sell-one-keep-both-the-real-decision>Sell One Keep Both: The Real Decision</h2><p>The classic duplex strategy is &ldquo;sell one to pay off the build, keep one as an investment.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a solid approach, but the numbers need to actually work.</p><h3 id=sell-one-keep-one>Sell One, Keep One</h3><p><strong>The appeal:</strong> You end up with a brand new investment property with minimal debt, funded largely by selling the other unit. It&rsquo;s essentially manufacturing equity.</p><p><strong>When it works:</strong></p><ul><li>Your end values comfortably exceed total project cost</li><li>Selling one unit covers at least 80-90% of total project costs</li><li>The retained unit generates positive cash flow at the reduced debt level</li><li>You can handle the cash flow during the build period</li></ul><p><strong>When it doesn&rsquo;t work:</strong></p><ul><li>Tight margins mean selling one unit barely covers costs</li><li>Market conditions soften during the 12-18 month build period</li><li>You&rsquo;ve overcapitalised on finishes that the market won&rsquo;t pay for</li></ul><h3 id=keep-both>Keep Both</h3><p><strong>The appeal:</strong> Maximum long-term wealth building. Two properties appreciating simultaneously, both generating rental income.</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> You need deep pockets or very favourable financing. Keeping both means carrying the full development debt (or refinancing to a lower LVR), and the rental yield on new duplexes in capital cities is typically 3-4% gross — which means you&rsquo;ll be negatively geared for years.</p><p><strong>This strategy suits:</strong></p><ul><li>High-income earners who benefit from negative gearing</li><li>Long-term investors (10+ year hold minimum)</li><li>Those with equity in other properties to offset the debt</li></ul><h2 id=financing-a-duplex-build-in-2026>Financing a Duplex Build in 2026</h2><h3 id=standard-financing-structure>Standard Financing Structure</h3><p>Most lenders treat duplex developments as construction loans with different rules than standard home loans:</p><ul><li><strong>LVR:</strong> 80% is standard for duplex construction loans. Some lenders will go to 90% with LMI, but expect higher rates and tougher serviceability requirements.</li><li><strong>Deposit:</strong> You&rsquo;ll typically need 20% of total project cost as equity/cash. On a $2M project, that&rsquo;s $400,000.</li><li><strong>Interest:</strong> Construction loans are typically variable rate, interest-only during the build period. Expect 6.5-7.5% in the current market (early 2026).</li><li><strong>Progress payments:</strong> The bank pays the builder in stages (base, frame, lockup, fixing, completion). You pay interest only on the drawn amount.</li></ul><h3 id=the-funding-gap-problem>The Funding Gap Problem</h3><p>Here&rsquo;s something that catches people out. Banks value the finished duplex based on their own valuation, not your optimistic spreadsheet. If the bank values each completed unit at $1,050,000 (total $2,100,000) but your project costs are $1,900,000, your 80% LVR gives you a loan of $1,680,000. That leaves a <strong>$220,000 gap</strong> you need to fund with cash or equity from another property.</p><p>Always get a preliminary valuation (or &ldquo;on-completion valuation&rdquo;) before committing to a project. If the numbers don&rsquo;t stack up with the bank&rsquo;s values, walk away or renegotiate the land price.</p><h2 id=state-by-state-what-you-need-to-know>State-by-State: What You Need to Know</h2><p>Duplex development rules vary significantly across Australian states.
