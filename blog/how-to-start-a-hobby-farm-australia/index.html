<article class="post-content">
  <p>Dreaming of wide paddocks, a chook pen out the back, and rows of fresh vegies you grew yourself? You&rsquo;re not alone. The hobby farm movement in Australia has exploded over the past few years, fuelled by rising food costs, a growing appetite for self-sufficiency, and the shift to remote work making a tree-change genuinely possible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a gap between the daydream and actually doing it. This guide walks you through the real steps to getting your hobby farm off the ground — from finding the right land to keeping everything running without burning out.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-hobby-farm">What Exactly Is a Hobby Farm?</h2>
<p>A hobby farm is a small-scale farm — typically under 20 hectares — where the primary goal isn&rsquo;t commercial profit. You might sell surplus eggs, fruit, or honey at a local market, but the main driver is lifestyle: growing your own food, keeping animals, and living closer to the land.</p>
<p>Legally, the ATO distinguishes between a hobby and a business based on whether you&rsquo;re operating with a genuine profit intention. If you&rsquo;re just growing for yourself and selling a few boxes of tomatoes, you&rsquo;re a hobbyist. If you start turning a consistent profit, you may need an ABN and to report that income.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-choose-your-land-wisely">Step 1: Choose Your Land Wisely</h2>
<p>This is the biggest decision you&rsquo;ll make. Here&rsquo;s what to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water access</strong>: Bore water, dam, creek frontage, or reliable rainfall. Without water, nothing else matters. Check the Bureau of Meteorology&rsquo;s historical rainfall data for the area.</li>
<li><strong>Soil quality</strong>: Sandy, clay, loam — each has trade-offs. Get a soil test before you buy. Your local Landcare group can point you to testing services.</li>
<li><strong>Zoning</strong>: Check with your local council that the land is zoned for rural or agricultural use. Some peri-urban blocks have restrictions on livestock numbers, outbuildings, or water bore drilling.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: For a basic hobby farm with vegies, fruit trees, and a few chooks, you can get started on as little as 2–5 acres (about 1–2 hectares). Larger stock like cattle or sheep need 10+ hectares minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Grid connection</strong>: Remote properties may not have mains power. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a problem — off-grid solar systems have come down significantly in cost — but it&rsquo;s something to factor into your budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>Land prices vary wildly. Peri-urban hobby farm blocks (within 1–2 hours of a capital city) typically range from $300,000 to $800,000+, while more remote acreages can be found from $150,000. Broadacre farmland averages around $4,000–$5,000 per hectare nationally, though small hobby-sized blocks carry a premium per hectare.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-start-small--really-small">Step 2: Start Small — Really Small</h2>
<p>The number one mistake new hobby farmers make is trying to do everything at once. You don&rsquo;t need goats, bees, an orchard, a vegie garden, and a dam full of yabbies in year one. Pick two or three things and do them well.</p>
<p>A solid starting combination:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A vegie garden</strong> — Raised beds or no-dig beds are the fastest way to start producing food. They work on poor soil, are easier on your back, and can be set up in a weekend.</li>
<li><strong>Chickens</strong> — Six to ten laying hens will keep a family in eggs and help with pest control. Check local council limits.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit trees</strong> — Plant these early because they take 2–3 years to produce. Citrus, stone fruit, and figs do well across most of Australia.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-3-set-up-your-water-and-power">Step 3: Set Up Your Water and Power</h2>
<h3 id="water">Water</h3>
<p>For growing food, you&rsquo;ll need a reliable irrigation setup. Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rainwater tanks</strong> — A 22,500L tank is a good starting point. Budget $2,000–$4,000 installed.</li>
<li><strong>Bore water</strong> — Can cost $5,000–$15,000 to drill, but provides a reliable year-round supply.</li>
<li><strong>Dam</strong> — If your property has the right contour, a farm dam is a fantastic asset. Council permits may be required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Automate your irrigation from the start. Smart irrigation controllers connected to soil moisture sensors can cut your water usage by 30–50% and save you hours of manual watering each week. For a full walkthrough of setting up automated watering systems — including drip irrigation, timers, and soil sensors — grab a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GN3RYDSC"><em>Set and Forget: The Automated Gardening Guide</em></a> on Amazon.</p>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on-grid, you&rsquo;re sorted. If you&rsquo;re remote or want energy independence, a standalone solar system is the go. A basic off-grid setup (5kW solar + 10kWh battery + inverter) starts around $20,000–$30,000 for a small property. Larger systems for a full household run $35,000–$60,000.</p>
<p>For detailed guidance on designing and living with off-grid power — including battery sizing, backup generators, and staying connected with Starlink — <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GMVBDWJR"><em>Off-Grid but Online</em></a> covers everything for just $5 on Amazon.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-think-about-livestock">Step 4: Think About Livestock</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going beyond chooks, here&rsquo;s a rough guide:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Animal</th>
          <th>Min. Land Needed</th>
          <th>Startup Cost</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Chickens (10)</td>
          <td>Small pen + run</td>
          <td>$500–$1,000</td>
          <td>Easiest livestock. Great for beginners.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Goats (2–4)</td>
          <td>1+ hectare</td>
          <td>$800–$2,000</td>
          <td>Excellent for clearing lantana and blackberry. Need good fencing.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Sheep (small flock)</td>
          <td>2+ hectares</td>
          <td>$1,000–$3,000</td>
          <td>Wiltipoll or Dorper breeds are low-maintenance.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Cattle (2–3)</td>
          <td>5+ hectares</td>
          <td>$3,000–$8,000</td>
          <td>Requires proper fencing, water, and handling yards.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Bees (2 hives)</td>
          <td>Anywhere</td>
          <td>$1,000–$2,000</td>
          <td>Check for Varroa mite management requirements in your state.</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2 id="step-5-automate-what-you-can">Step 5: Automate What You Can</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where modern hobby farming differs from your grandparents&rsquo; version. Technology can take the drudgery out of daily tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic chicken coop doors</strong> — Solar-powered doors that open at dawn and close at dusk. No more forgetting to lock the chooks in.</li>
<li><strong>Smart irrigation</strong> — Drip systems on timers with soil moisture sensors. Water only when and where it&rsquo;s needed.</li>
<li><strong>Weather stations</strong> — A basic home weather station helps you plan planting, watering, and harvesting.</li>
<li><strong>Solar-powered electric fencing</strong> — Keep stock in and foxes out without running mains power to the paddock.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key philosophy is &ldquo;set and forget&rdquo; — invest time upfront building good systems so you&rsquo;re not a slave to daily chores. Both <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GN3RYDSC"><em>Set and Forget</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0GMVBDWJR"><em>Off-Grid but Online</em></a> dig deep into this approach.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-know-the-legal-stuff">Step 6: Know the Legal Stuff</h2>
<p>Before you jump in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Council permits</strong>: You may need development approvals for sheds, dams, or livestock shelters.</li>
<li><strong>Biosecurity</strong>: Register with your state&rsquo;s biosecurity authority if keeping livestock. Property Identification Codes (PICs) are mandatory for cattle, sheep, and goats.</li>
<li><strong>Water licences</strong>: Some states require licences for bore water extraction or dam construction.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Standard home insurance may not cover farm structures, livestock, or liability for visitors. Talk to a rural insurance broker.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started-this-weekend">Getting Started This Weekend</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need 50 acres to begin. If you&rsquo;ve got a suburban backyard, start with a no-dig raised bed and a few herb seedlings. If you&rsquo;ve already got land, pick your easiest win — maybe it&rsquo;s six chooks and a rainwater tank — and build from there.</p>
<p>The best hobby farms grow organically (in every sense). Start small, learn as you go, and add new projects each season.</p>
