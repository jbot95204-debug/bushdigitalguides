## ☀️ Solar Sizing Basics

Before you buy a single panel, you need to know how much power you actually use.

### Step 1: Work Out Your Daily Usage

| Appliance | Typical Watts | Hours/Day | Daily Wh |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Fridge | 150W | 24 (avg ~60W) | 1,440 |
| LED Lights (×6) | 60W total | 5 | 300 |
| Laptop | 65W | 4 | 260 |
| Phone charging (×2) | 20W | 3 | 60 |
| Washing machine | 500W | 0.5 | 250 |
| Microwave | 1,000W | 0.3 | 300 |
| Water pump | 800W | 0.5 | 400 |
| **Modest off-grid total** | | | **~3–5 kWh/day** |

**Rule of thumb:** A modest off-grid home uses 3–8 kWh/day. A comfortable setup with aircon can hit 10–15 kWh/day.

### Step 2: Size Your Solar Array

- **Adelaide/SA (Zone 3):** Each 1kW of panels produces ~4.2 kWh/day average
- **Oversize by 30–50%** to account for cloudy days and winter
- **Minimum recommendation:** 3kW system for basic off-grid, 6.6kW+ for comfortable living

| Daily Usage | Minimum Solar | Recommended Solar | Approx. Cost (Panels Only) |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 3–5 kWh | 2kW | 3–4kW | $1,500–$3,000 |
| 5–10 kWh | 3kW | 5–6.6kW | $3,000–$5,500 |
| 10–15 kWh | 5kW | 8–10kW | $5,000–$8,000 |

### ✅ Solar Checklist
- [ ] Calculate your actual daily power usage (don't guess)
- [ ] Check your roof/ground space — each panel needs ~2m²
- [ ] Face panels north (in Australia) with 20–30° tilt
- [ ] Get at least 3 quotes from CEC-accredited installers
- [ ] Ask about hybrid inverters if you want battery-ready
- [ ] Check for shading — even partial shade kills output

## 🔋 Battery Selection

Batteries are the most expensive part of an off-grid system. Get this right.

### Battery Types at a Glance

| Type | Lifespan | Depth of Discharge | Cost/kWh (AUD) | Best For |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) | 10–15 years | 90–100% | $800–$1,200 | Most off-grid setups |
| Lead-Acid (AGM/Gel) | 3–5 years | 50% | $300–$500 | Ultra-budget only |
| Flow batteries | 20+ years | 100% | $1,200–$1,800 | Long-term, large systems |

**Our recommendation:** LFP (lithium iron phosphate) every time. The upfront cost is higher but the lifecycle cost is far lower. Lead-acid is false economy.

### How Much Battery Do You Need?

- **1 day of autonomy** (minimum): Match your daily usage in usable kWh
- **2 days** (recommended for off-grid): Double it
- **Example:** 5 kWh/day usage → 10 kWh usable battery minimum

### Popular Batteries in Australia (2025–2026 Pricing)

| Battery | Usable Capacity | Approx. Cost (AUD) |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| BYD HVS 5.1 | 5.1 kWh | $4,500–$5,500 |
| Tesla Powerwall 2 | 13.5 kWh | $12,000–$14,000 |
| Sungrow SBR128 | 12.8 kWh | $8,000–$10,000 |
| Pylontech US5000 | 4.8 kWh (stackable) | $3,500–$4,500 |
| Redback SH5000 | 4.8 kWh (stackable) | $4,000–$5,000 |

### ✅ Battery Checklist
- [ ] Size for at least 1 day of autonomy (2 days for true off-grid)
- [ ] Choose LFP chemistry — skip lead-acid unless budget is dire
- [ ] Check the warranty — 10 years minimum, check cycle count
- [ ] Ensure battery is compatible with your inverter
- [ ] Plan battery location — cool, ventilated, protected from weather
- [ ] Budget for a hybrid or off-grid inverter (not just a standard solar inverter)

## 💧 Water Systems

No water = no off-grid. This is non-negotiable.

### Water Sources

| Source | Pros | Cons | Setup Cost (AUD) |
|--------|------|------|-----------------|
| Rainwater tanks | Free water, good quality | Depends on rainfall, space | $2,000–$8,000 |
| Bore/well | Reliable supply | Drilling cost, pump power, may be saline | $5,000–$15,000 |
| Creek/dam | Abundant if available | Filtration needed, seasonal | $1,000–$5,000 |
| Trucked water | No infrastructure needed | Ongoing cost, not self-sufficient | $200–$400/delivery |

### Tank Sizing Rule of Thumb

- **Average rainfall** in your area (mm/year) × **roof catchment area** (m²) × 0.8 = annual litres collected
- **Adelaide example:** 530mm rain × 150m² roof × 0.8 = **63,600L/year**
- **Daily usage:** Budget 200–400L/day per person (drinking, cooking, washing, garden)
- **Minimum tank size:** 22,500L (one month's supply for a couple)

### ✅ Water Checklist
- [ ] Identify your primary water source
- [ ] Size your tanks — minimum 22,500L for a couple
- [ ] Install first-flush diverters on rainwater collection
- [ ] Budget for a pump ($500–$1,500) and pressure tank ($300–$600)
- [ ] Plan filtration: sediment filter + UV steriliser for drinking water (~$500–$1,000)
- [ ] Consider a greywater system for garden use
- [ ] Get a water quality test if using bore/creek water (~$150)

## 📡 Internet Options

Being off-grid doesn't mean being offline. Here's what actually works in regional Australia.

| Option | Speed | Monthly Cost | Setup Cost | Best For |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Starlink Standard** | 50–200 Mbps | $139/mo | $599 (dish) | Most off-grid properties |
| **Starlink Roam** | 5–50 Mbps | $65/mo (50GB) | $599 (dish) | Mobile/travelling use |
| **4G/5G Fixed Wireless** | 10–100 Mbps | $55–$85/mo | $0–$300 (antenna) | Good 4G coverage areas |
| **NBN Satellite (Sky Muster)** | 12–25 Mbps | $45–$70/mo | Free install | Budget, light usage |
| **External 4G Antenna** | 10–50 Mbps | SIM plan | $200–$600 | Marginal signal areas |

### Our Take

**Starlink is a game-changer for off-grid.** It works basically anywhere in Australia with a clear view of sky, the speeds are genuinely usable (video calls, streaming, remote work), and the $139/mo is reasonable for what you get. Power draw is 40–75W average — factor that into your solar sizing.

If you've got decent Telstra or Optus signal, a **4G router with an external antenna** (Cel-Fi GO or similar) can be cheaper long-term and uses less power (~10–15W).

### ✅ Internet Checklist
- [ ] Check Starlink availability at your address (starlink.com)
- [ ] Test mobile signal with different carriers before committing
- [ ] Budget 50–100W continuous power draw for Starlink
- [ ] Consider a UPS or battery backup for your router
- [ ] External antenna? Check line-of-sight to the nearest tower
- [ ] Plan for a backup option (mobile hotspot at minimum)

## 🚨 Before You Commit — The Reality Check

- [ ] **Council approval** — Check if your property allows off-grid dwellings
- [ ] **Access** — Can trucks deliver materials? Is the road sealed?
- [ ] **Bushfire rating** — BAL rating affects insurance and build requirements
- [ ] **Soil test** — Needed for septic/wastewater systems ($500–$1,000)
- [ ] **Insurance** — Off-grid properties can be harder to insure. Get quotes early.
- [ ] **Skills audit** — What can you DIY vs what needs a licensed tradie?
- [ ] **Visit in winter** — That dream block looks different when it's cold, wet, and muddy
