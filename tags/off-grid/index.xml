      <description>&lt;p&gt;Solar batteries have gone from niche tech-geek territory to genuinely mainstream in Australia. With electricity prices still climbing, generous federal rebates now in play, and battery prices dropping year on year, 2026 is shaping up as the best time yet to add storage to your solar setup — or to go fully off-grid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But with over 30 brands on the market, wildly different price points, and specs that can be hard to compare, choosing the right battery is confusing. This guide cuts through the marketing and breaks down what actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of wide paddocks, a chook pen out the back, and rows of fresh vegies you grew yourself? You&amp;rsquo;re not alone.

This guide walks you through the real steps to getting your hobby farm off the ground — from finding the right land to keeping everything running without burning out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nice bonus, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing most people don&amp;rsquo;t realise: that rebate is about to change significantly. From &lt;strong&gt;May 2026&lt;/strong&gt;, the way Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) apply to batteries is getting restructured. Depending on the size of the battery you&amp;rsquo;re looking at, you could be looking at a noticeably smaller discount if you wait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
