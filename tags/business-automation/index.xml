      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a small business in Australia, chances are you&amp;rsquo;re spending half your week on tasks a computer could handle: chasing invoices, scheduling appointments, answering the same customer questions, posting on social media, reconciling books. It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting, and it&amp;rsquo;s keeping you from the work that actually grows your business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news?

Quotes going out late, jobs double-booked, invoices in a pile. You&amp;rsquo;re running your business from text messages, a notebook, and whatever you remember after your third coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Job management software fixes this. But choosing the wrong one is almost worse than having none — you&amp;rsquo;ll spend weeks setting it up, hate using it, and go back to the notebook within a month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
