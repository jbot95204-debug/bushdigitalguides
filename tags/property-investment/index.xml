Granny flat investment in Australia has absolutely exploded over the past few years — and in 2026, the numbers are making more sense than ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With national home values up 8.8% over 2025 according to PropTrack, rental vacancy rates still tight in most capitals, and building costs starting to stabilise after the post-COVID blowout, adding a secondary dwelling to your existing property is one of the smartest value-add plays going around.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zoning Reform Could Slash $100K Off House Prices — What It Means for Property Investors</title><link>https://bushdigitalguides.com.au/blog/zoning-reform-property-investment-australia-2026/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bushdigitalguides.com.au/blog/zoning-reform-property-investment-australia-2026/</guid><description>&lt;p>What if the biggest opportunity — and the biggest threat — to your property portfolio isn&amp;rsquo;t interest rates, CGT changes, or immigration numbers?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if it&amp;rsquo;s the way councils draw lines on maps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Grattan Institute has just dropped a major report arguing that Australia could knock &lt;strong>more than $100,000 off the typical house price&lt;/strong> simply by changing how we zone our suburbs. No new taxes. No government handouts. Just letting people build the homes that are actually needed, where they&amp;rsquo;re actually needed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CGT Discount Changes: What Australian Property Investors Need to Know in 2026</title><link>https://bushdigitalguides.com.au/blog/cgt-discount-changes-what-property-investors-need-to-know-2026/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:30:00 +1030</pubDate><guid>https://bushdigitalguides.com.au/blog/cgt-discount-changes-what-property-investors-need-to-know-2026/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been anywhere near the news this past fortnight, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed something big brewing: the federal government is openly floating changes to the capital gains tax discount. For the first time in years, senior Labor figures aren&amp;rsquo;t shutting down the conversation — they&amp;rsquo;re leaning into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For property investors, particularly those of us running value-add strategies, this could be a genuine game-changer. So let&amp;rsquo;s cut through the political noise and figure out what&amp;rsquo;s actually happening, what it means for your portfolio, and whether you should be panicking or planning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NDIS SDA Housing Investment in 2026: The Oversupply Nobody Warned You About</title><link>https://bushdigitalguides.com.au/blog/ndis-sda-housing-oversupply-2026/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bushdigitalguides.com.au/blog/ndis-sda-housing-oversupply-2026/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let me save you some money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been targeted by a property spruiker, a &amp;ldquo;wealth coach,&amp;rdquo; or a slick marketing funnel promising 10%+ rental yields from NDIS SDA (Specialist Disability Accommodation) housing, you need to read this before you sign anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not saying SDA housing is a scam. It&amp;rsquo;s not. There are legitimate SDA providers doing important work housing Australians with significant disabilities. The NDIS SDA program exists for a critical reason, and the people living in these homes genuinely need them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
