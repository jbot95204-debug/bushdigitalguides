# Solar & Battery Rebate Calculator 2026

**How STCs work, what you'll save, and why timing matters**

---

## What Are STCs?

Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) are the Australian government's solar rebate mechanism. When you install solar panels or batteries, the system generates a number of "certificates" based on its size and location. These certificates have a dollar value, and your installer typically discounts them from your quote upfront.

**Translation:** STCs = the reason a $12,000 solar system costs you $8,000. The "rebate" isn't a cheque from the government — it's a market-based discount applied at point of sale.

---

## How Many STCs Does Your System Generate?

### Panel STCs Formula

**STCs = System Size (kW) × Zone Rating × Deeming Years**

That's it. Three numbers multiplied together.

### Zone Ratings (How Sunny Is Your Area?)

Australia is divided into four zones based on solar radiation. Sunnier areas generate more STCs per kilowatt.

| Zone | Rating | Locations |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** | 1.622 | Darwin, Far North QLD, Top End |
| **Zone 2** | 1.536 | Brisbane, Perth, most of QLD & WA |
| **Zone 3** | 1.382 | **Adelaide**, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Hobart, most of SA/NSW/VIC |
| **Zone 4** | 1.185 | Parts of southern TAS, alpine regions |

*Most Australians are in Zone 2 or Zone 3.*

### Deeming Years (The Countdown)

STCs are calculated based on years remaining until 2030, when the scheme ends. This number drops every 1 January:

| Install Year | Deeming Years | Impact |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **2026** | **5** | **Current** |
| 2027 | 4 | 20% fewer STCs |
| 2028 | 3 | 40% fewer STCs |
| 2029 | 2 | 60% fewer STCs |
| 2030 | 1 | Last year — minimum STCs |

**Key takeaway:** Every year you wait, your rebate drops by roughly 20%. The scheme doesn't end with a bang — it fades out.

## Battery STCs — The New Kid

Since April 2023, eligible battery systems also generate STCs. This is separate from the panel STCs.

### Battery STC Formula

**Battery STCs = Usable Capacity (kWh) × STC Factor**

| Period | STC Factor per kWh | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Until 30 April 2026 | **8.4 STCs/kWh** | Current rate |
| From 1 May 2026 | **Lower rate (TBC)** | Rate reduces — install before May to maximise |

**Important limits:**
- Only the first **50 kWh of usable capacity** qualifies
- Battery must be on the CEC Approved Batteries list
- "Usable" capacity is typically 90% of nominal capacity

---

## ⚠️ Key Deadline: 1 May 2026

The battery STC rate changes on 1 May 2026. If you're planning a battery install, getting it done before this date locks in the higher 8.4 STCs/kWh rate.

**On a 10kWh battery, this could mean $1,000+ difference in your rebate.**

## Worked Example: 6.6kW Solar + 10kWh Battery in Adelaide

Let's run the numbers for a typical Adelaide installation in 2026.

### Panel STCs

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| System size | 6.6 kW |
| Zone rating (Adelaide, Zone 3) | 1.382 |
| Deeming years (2026) | 5 |
| **Panel STCs** | **6.6 × 1.382 × 5 = 45 STCs** |

*STCs are rounded down to the nearest whole number.*

### Battery STCs

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Nominal capacity | 10 kWh |
| Usable capacity (90%) | 9 kWh |
| STC factor (before May 2026) | 8.4 |
| **Battery STCs** | **9 × 8.4 = 75 STCs** |

### Total Rebate Value

| Component | STCs | Value @ $37/STC* | Value @ $40/STC** |
|-----------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Panels (6.6kW) | 45 | $1,665 | $1,800 |
| Battery (10kWh) | 75 | $2,775 | $3,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **120** | **$4,440** | **$4,800** |

*\*$37 = typical trade price after agent/aggregator fees*
*\*\*$40 = STC clearing house price (ex GST) — theoretical maximum*

### What This Means for Your Quote

| Item | Approximate Cost |
|------|-----------------|
| 6.6kW solar system (panels + inverter + install) | $7,000–$9,000 |
| 10kWh battery (supply + install) | $8,000–$12,000 |
| **Gross total** | **$15,000–$21,000** |
| Less STC rebate | –$4,400 to –$4,800 |
| **You pay** | **$10,200–$16,200** |

*Prices vary significantly by brand, installer, and roof complexity. Always get 3 quotes.*

## Quick Calculator: Find Your Rebate

### Step 1: Panel STCs

Your system size: _____ kW

× Your zone rating: _____ (see table above)

× 5 (deeming years for 2026)

= **_____ Panel STCs**

### Step 2: Battery STCs (if applicable)

Your battery usable capacity: _____ kWh

× 8.4 (before May 2026)

= **_____ Battery STCs**

### Step 3: Total Value

Total STCs (Panel + Battery): _____

× $37 (conservative) = **$_____**

× $40 (optimistic) = **$_____**

## Common Scenarios — Quick Reference

| System | Location | Panel STCs | Battery STCs | Total STCs | Rebate ($37) |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 6.6kW panels only | Adelaide (Z3) | 45 | — | 45 | $1,665 |
| 6.6kW panels only | Brisbane (Z2) | 50 | — | 50 | $1,850 |

| Battery only (10kWh) | Any zone | — | 75 | 75 | $2,775 |

## Tips to Maximise Your Rebate

1. **Don't wait.** Deeming years drop every January. A 2026 install gets 5 years; a 2027 install gets 4. That's a 20% reduction.

2. **Install batteries before 1 May 2026.** The STC factor drops after this date. If you're on the fence, this is your deadline.

3. **Use a CEC-accredited installer.** STCs can only be created by Clean Energy Council accredited installers. No accreditation = no rebate.

4. **Check your battery is on the CEC list.** Not all batteries qualify. Your installer should confirm this, but it's worth checking yourself at the CEC website.

5. **Get 3 quotes minimum.** STC values are standardised, but installer margins vary wildly. The same system can differ by $3,000+ between quotes.

6. **Ask how STCs are handled.** Most installers discount STCs upfront (you "assign" them to the installer). Some offer cash-back instead. Either way, make sure the STC value is clearly shown on your quote.

## State Government Rebates (On Top of STCs)

STCs are a federal scheme. Some states offer additional rebates:

| State | Additional Rebates (2025–2026) | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **SA** | Home Battery Scheme — up to $2,000 | Check eligibility at sa.gov.au |
| **VIC** | Solar Homes Program — rebates + interest-free loans | Income-tested, check solar.vic.gov.au |
| **NSW** | Peak Demand Reduction Scheme (via retailers) | Varies by energy retailer |
| **QLD** | Battery Booster — up to $4,000 (selected areas) | Check eligibility |

*State schemes change frequently. Always verify current availability before committing.*
