## State-by-State Rules (2025–2026)

| | **SA** | **NSW** | **QLD** | **VIC** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Max size** | 70m² | 60m² | Varies by council | 60m² |
| **Min lot size** | 600m² | 450m² | Varies by council | 300m²* |
| **Approval pathway** | DA required | CDC (private certifier) | Varies by council | Building permit only |
| **Rent to anyone?** | ✅ Yes (since 2023) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (since Sep 2022) | ✅ Yes |
| **Typical approval time** | 3–6 months | 2–4 weeks (CDC) | 3–6 months | 4–8 weeks |
| **Can be subdivided?** | No | No | No | No |

*VIC: Lots under 300m² in most residential zones need planning permit (VC282, Sep 2025)*

### State Highlights

**South Australia**
- Size increased from 60m² to 70m² in November 2024
- Family-only restrictions removed statewide in 2023 — all granny flats can now be rented to anyone
- DA required (no fast-track CDC pathway like NSW)
- 20m² private open space required

**New South Wales — The Gold Standard**
- CDC pathway = no council involvement, just a private certifier
- 10–20 business days for approval
- Minimum 12m lot width at the building line
- Bushfire zones BAL-40+ can't get CDC — must go DA
- Concept to keys in under 6 months

**Queensland**
- Approval pathway varies by council — some accepted development, some full DA
- 1,800mm fire separation required between dwellings when renting to non-household
- No single statewide size cap — check your local planning scheme

**Victoria — The Big Reform**
- December 2023 reforms (VC253/VC259) = "small second dwelling" — no planning permit needed
- Just a building permit from a registered building surveyor
- Must not connect to reticulated natural gas
- No car parking required
- Properties with flood/environmental overlays still need planning permit

## Real Costs — What You'll Actually Pay

**The advertised "$150k granny flat" almost never includes everything.** Here's the real breakdown:

### Full Cost by Tier

| Component | Basic (30–40m²) | Mid-Range (45–60m²) | High-End (60m²+) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Design + plans | $2k–$5k | $5k–$12k | $10k–$20k |
| Approvals | $3k–$5k | $5k–$10k | $8k–$15k |
| Build (turnkey) | $80k–$120k | $150k–$200k | $200k–$300k |
| Site works | $5k–$15k | $8k–$30k | $15k–$50k |
| Services connection | $5k–$12k | $8k–$15k | $10k–$20k |
| Landscaping + fencing | $3k–$8k | $5k–$12k | $8k–$20k |
| **TOTAL** | **$98k–$165k** | **$181k–$279k** | **$251k–$425k** |

**Most investors land in the mid-range: $180,000–$250,000 all-in.**

### Community Rule of Thumb

**~$2,500 per square metre** for a quality build including site costs. *(r/AusPropertyChat, 2024)*

### Build Method Comparison

| Method | Cost Range | Build Time | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Flat-pack/kit | $70k–$110k | Variable | Owner-builders with skills |
| Modular prefab | $120k–$180k | 8–12 weeks factory + 1–2 weeks on-site | Speed, quality control |
| Custom on-site | $140k–$250k+ | 16–24 weeks | Difficult sites, full customisation |

## Rental Returns

These yields make standard residential investing look like a savings account.

| City | Weekly Rent (2-bed) | Annual Income | Yield on $220k Build |
|------|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Sydney** | $450–$600 | $23,400–$31,200 | 10.6–14.2% |
| **Melbourne** | $350–$450 | $18,200–$23,400 | 8.3–10.6% |
| **Brisbane** | $380–$480 | $19,760–$24,960 | 9.0–11.3% |
| **Adelaide** | $320–$420 | $16,640–$21,840 | 7.6–9.9% |
| **Perth** | $350–$450 | $18,200–$23,400 | 8.3–10.6% |

*Compare to national average house rental yield of ~4.9% (Global Property Guide, Q3 2025)*

## Quick Feasibility Template

Run these numbers before committing to any property:

### Income

| | Weekly | Annual |
|---|---|---|
| Main house rent | $ | $ |
| Granny flat rent | $ | $ |
| **Combined** | **$** | **$** |

### Costs

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Purchase price | $ |
| Stamp duty + legals | $ |
| Granny flat build (all-in) | $ |
| Contingency (10% of build) | $ |
| Holding costs during build | $ |
| **Total investment** | **$** |

### The Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Your Number |
|--------|------------|
| Gross yield (combined rent ÷ total investment) | % |
| Yield on GF cost only (GF rent ÷ GF build cost) | % |
| Estimated property value post-build | $ |
| Equity created (post-build value – total debt) | $ |

**Minimum targets:** Yield on GF cost > 8%. Equity created > GF build cost.

## CDC vs DA — Know Which Pathway You Need

| | CDC | DA |
|---|---|---|
| **Who assesses** | Private certifier | Council planner |
| **Timeline** | 2–4 weeks | 3–6+ months |
| **Application cost** | $2,500–$3,500 | $2,000–$9,000+ |
| **Neighbour notification** | No | Yes (may trigger objections) |
| **Flexibility** | None — must meet ALL criteria | Can approve variations |
| **Available in** | NSW (primary), WA + VIC have similar | All states |

**Rule of thumb:** Always try for CDC first. If the site doesn't qualify, go DA.

## The Gotchas That Kill Profits

### 1. Drainage & Stormwater
Rear-sloping sites can add $10,000–$30,000 in drainage works. Check the Deposited Plan for easements before committing.

### 2. Sewer
Building near sewer mains triggers zone-of-influence assessment. Building OVER sewer mains requires encasement — very costly. Get a sewer diagram ($26 from Sydney Water or equivalent).

### 3. Bushfire (BAL Levels)
- BAL-Low to BAL-29: Manageable (adds $0–$15k)
- BAL-40 or Flame Zone: Can double build costs. May make project unfeasible.

### 4. Easements
Building over easements is generally prohibited. This can make a granny flat impossible — check the DP before purchasing.

### 5. Infrastructure Charges
- **NSW:** $20,000–$30,000+ in growth areas (s7.11 contributions + HPC)
- **QLD:** ~$32,000 per dwelling (some council discounts available)
- **SA:** ~$6,000 per dwelling

### 6. Hidden Costs in Builder Quotes
Things often NOT included in the "turnkey" price:
- [ ] Air conditioning
- [ ] Fly screens
- [ ] NBN connection
- [ ] Smoke alarms
- [ ] Landscaping and turf
- [ ] Fencing between dwellings
- [ ] Driveway modifications
- [ ] Letterbox and clothesline

**Always get a written list of inclusions and exclusions.**

### 7. Valuation Risk
If nobody in the suburb is paying $1.1M, you won't get a $1.1M valuation — no matter how nice your granny flat is.

## The Construction Timeline

| Stage | What Happens | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Site prep | Clear, level, temp fencing | 1–2 weeks |
| Slab/foundations | Concrete, plumbing rough-in | 1–2 weeks |
| Frame | Wall frames and roof trusses | 1–2 weeks |
| Lockup | Roof, cladding, windows, doors | 2–3 weeks |
| Rough-in | Wiring, plumbing, insulation | 1–2 weeks |
| Lining | Plasterboard, wet area waterproofing | 1–2 weeks |
| Fixing | Kitchen, bathroom, tiling, paint, flooring | 2–4 weeks |
| Completion | Final connections, landscaping, OC | 1–2 weeks |

**Total: 10–20 weeks build + 2–8 weeks approval. Concept to keys: 4–7 months.**
